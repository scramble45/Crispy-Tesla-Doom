Crispy Doom is a limit-removing enhanced-resolution Doom source port based on [Chocolate Doom](https://www.chocolate-doom.org/wiki/index.php/Chocolate_Doom).

Its name means that its internal 640x400 resolution looks "crisp" and is also a [slight reference](http://www.mathsisfun.com/recipie.html) to its origin.

## Synopsis

Crispy Doom is a friendly fork of [Chocolate Doom](https://www.chocolate-doom.org/wiki/index.php/Chocolate_Doom) that provides a higher display resolution, removes the [static limits](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Static_limits) of the Doom engine and offers further optional visual, tactical and physical enhancements while remaining entirely config file, savegame, netplay and demo compatible with the original.

## Objectives and features

Crispy Doom is a source port that aims to provide a faithful Doom gaming experience while also featuring some user-requested improvements and enhancements. It is forked off of Chocolate Doom to take advantage of its free and open-source code base, portability, accuracy and compatibility with Vanilla Doom.

Its core features are:

 * Enhanced 640x400 display resolution, with the original 320x200 resolution still available in the "High Resolution Rendering: Off" mode.
 * Widescreen rendering for using all the available horizontal space of screens with aspect ratios up to 24:9.
 * Uncapped rendering framerate with interpolation and optional vertical synchronization (VSync) with the screen refresh rate.
 * Intermediate gamma correction levels (0.5, 1.5, 2.5 and 3.5).
 * Removal of all static engine limits, or at least raising of the less crucial ones.
 * Full support for the "Doom Classic" WADs shipped with the "Doom 3: BFG Edition", especially the "No Rest For The Living" episode shipped in the NERVE.WAD file.
 * Support for all versions of John Romero's Episode 5: Sigil for Ultimate Doom.

Furthermore, the following optional user-visible and audible features are available:

 * Jumping.
 * Free vertical looking, including mouse look and vertical aiming.
 * Aiming support by a crosshair that may get directly rendered into the game world.
 * A new minimal Crispy HUD, displaying only the status bar numbers.
 * Clean Screenshot feature, enabling to take screenshots without HUD elements and even without status bar numbers and weapon sprites at higher screen sizes.
 * Colorized status bar numbers, HUD texts and blood sprites for certain monsters.
 * Translucency for certain sprites and status bar elements in the Crispy HUD.
 * Randomly mirrored death animations and corpse sprites.
 * Command line options to allow for playing with flipped player weapon sprites and/or entirely flipped level geometry.
 * Players may walk over or under monsters and hanging corpses.
 * Centered Weapons when firing, weapon recoil thrust and pitch.
 * Reports whenever a secret is revealed.
 * Level statistics and extended coloring in the Automap.
 * Playing sounds in full length, and misc. other sound fixes.
 * Demo recording and/or playback timers and progress bar.
 * Demo continue and take-over features, handing controls over to the player when demo playback is finished or interrupted.

Most of these features are disabled by default and need to get enabled either in the in-game "Crispness" menu, in the crispy-doom-setup tool or as command line parameters. They are implemented in a way that preserves demo-compatibility with Vanilla Doom and network game compatibility with Chocolate Doom. Furthermore, Crispy Doom's savegames and config files are compatible, though not identical (see the [Compatibility section in the Wiki](https://github.com/fabiangreffrath/crispy-doom/wiki/Compatibility)), to Vanilla Doom's.

Crispy Doom strives for maximum compatibility with all "limit-removing Vanilla" maps -- but not Boom or ZDoom maps. More specifically, Crispy Doom supports some select advanced features such as [ANIMATED](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/ANIMATED) and [SWITCHES](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/SWITCHES) lumps, MBF sky transfers, SMMU swirling flats and [MUSINFO](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/MUSINFO) -- but neither generalized linedef and sector types nor DECORATE and MAPINFO.

Many additional less user-visible features have been implemented, e.g. fixed engine limitations and crashes, fixed rendering bugs, fixed harmless game logic bugs, full support for DEHACKED files and lumps in BEX format, additional and improved cheat codes, an improved Automap, and many more! Due to the extra DEHACKED states added from [MBF](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/MBF), Crispy Doom supports [enhancer](https://www.doomworld.com/forum/topic/84859-black-ops-smooth-weapons-dehacked-mod) [mods](https://www.doomworld.com/forum/topic/85991-smoothed-smooth-monsters-for-doom-retro-and-crispy-doom) that can make the gameplay even more pleasing to the eyes. For a detailed list of features and changes please refer to the release notes below.

### New command line parameters

 * `-dm3` specifies the Deathmatch 3.0 rules (weapons stay, items respawn) for netgames (since 4.1).
 * `-episode 1` launches Hell on Earth and `-episode 2` launches No Rest for the Living episode if the Doom 2 IWAD shipped with the Doom 3: BFG Edition is used.
 * `-warp 1a` warps to the secret level E1M10: Sewers of XBox Doom IWAD (since 2.3).
 * `-mergedump <file>` merges the PWAD file(s) given on the command line with the IWAD file and writes the resulting data into the `<file>` given as argument. May be considered as a replacement for the `DEUSF.EXE` tool (since 2.3).
 * `-lumpdump` dumps raw content of a lump into a file (since 5.7).
 * `-blockmap` forces a (re-)building of the BLOCKMAP lumps for loaded maps (since 2.3).
 * `-playdemo demoname -warp N` plays back fast-forward up to the requested map (since 3.0).
 * `-loadgame N -record demoname` and `-loadgame N -playdemo demoname` allow to record and play demos starting from a savegame instead of the level start (since 4.0).
 * `-playdemo demoname1 -record demoname2` plays back fast-forward until the end of demoname1 and continues recording as demoname2 (new in 5.5).

### New cheat codes

 * `TNTWEAP` followed by a weapon number gives or removes this weapon (8 = Chainsaw, 9 = SSG). `TNTWEAP0` takes away all weapons and ammo except for the pistol and 50 bullets. Try to load Doom 1 with `DOOM2.WAD` as a PWAD and type `TNTWEAP9` to play the SSG in Doom 1.
 * `TNTEM`, `KILLEM` or `FHHALL` kill all monsters on the current map (and disables all cube spitters).
 * `SPECHITS` triggers all [Linedef actions](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Linedef_type) on a map at once, no matter if they are enabled by pushing, walking over or shooting or whether they require a key or not. It also triggers all boss monster and Commander Keen actions if possible.
 * `NOTARGET` or `FHSHH` toggle deaf and blind monsters that do not act until attacked.
 * `TNTHOM` toggles the flashing [HOM](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Hall_of_mirrors_effect) indicator (disabled by default).

 * `IDCLEV00` restarts the current level (since 2.0).
 * `IDMUS00` restarts the current music (new in 5.1).
 * `VERSION` shows the engine version, build date and SDL version (new in 5.1).
 * `SKILL` shows the current skill level (new in 5.5.2).

## News

### Crispy Doom 5.10.1

Crispy Doom 5.10.1 is currently under development.

**New Features and Improvements**

 * Some colored text has been reverted back to the pristine Vanilla experience. As a rule of thumb, UI that has been inherited from Vanilla does doesn't get any colorization anymore (thanks @OpenRift412).
 * Screenwidth values are now rounded *down* to the nearest multiple of 4 in hires mode, and *up* in lores mode. This makes sure we end up with a screenwidth of 852 px for a 16:9 ratio in hires mode, which is exact twice the width of the widescreen assets, and with a screenwidth of 428 px in lores mode, which is the next integer multiple of 4 (thanks @buvk).
 * A CMake toggle has been added for the truecolor mode (by @zx64).

**Bug Fixes**

 * The weapon sprite coordinates now remain unchanged if neither variable bobbing nor weapon sprite centering is enabled. Coincidently, this will bring back the sloppy bobbing of the chainsaw weapon sprite during its idle frames.
 * Interpolation of the Archvile's fire sprite is now suppressed to mitigate it being spawned at the wrong location.
 * Status bar positioning, drawing of fullscreen patches and the bunny scroll screen have been fixed on big-endian systems.
 * The window height is now prevented from shrinking when changing widescreen modes.
 * The smooth automap lines features has been fixed for truecolor mode (by @zx64).

**Crispy Heretic**

 * Weapon pickup messages are now shown in cooperative multiplayer mode (by @xttl).
 * All Crispy Doom specific cheats have been ported over and adapted accordingly (by @xttl).
 * An Automap overlay mode has been added.
 * There are now separate mouse sensitivities for turn, strafe and y-axis.
 * Heretic now has a "demowarp" feature, i.e. support for using both `-playdemo` and `-warp` on the command line (thanks @thom-wye).

Crispy Doom 5.10.1 is based on Chocolate Doom 3.0.1 and has merged all changes to the Chocolate Doom master branch up to commit [`d5b1a695`](https://github.com/chocolate-doom/chocolate-doom/commit/d5b1a695090eb49da3a4277686a30920cd5de046).

### Crispy Doom 5.10.0

Crispy Doom 5.10.0 is released on Jan 12, 2021. Its major new feature is the addition of support for the widescreen assets found e.g. in the Unity version of Doom.

**New Features and Improvements**

 * Proper support for widescreen assets has been added (by @SmileTheory, thanks @ghost and @chungy).
 * The bezel bottom edge to the left and right of the status bar in widescreen mode is now preserved (thanks braders1986 and @SmileTheory).
 * Special treatment is now applied to the No Rest for the Living and The Masterlevels expansions - even during network games, demo recording and playback. This includes level transitions to the secret maps and back, finale text screens, par times, etc. (thanks Coincident and Keyboard_Doomer for input from the DSDA community).
 * Menu scrolling with the mouse wheel has been improved to be more responsive (by @JNechaevsky).
 * All textures are now always composed, whether they are multi-patched or not. Furthermore, two separate composites are created, one for opaque and one for translucent mid-textures on 2S walls. Additionally, textures may now be arbitrarily tall.
 * Freedoom Phase 2 and FreeDM are now explicitly named in the Doom 2 Episode menu.
 * The status bar is now redrawn in the Main, Episode and Skill menus, where it could get overridden by custom graphics (thanks @JNechaevsky).

**Bug Fixes**

 * A crash has been fixed when the -record and -pistolstart parameters were used simultaneously (thanks Spie812).
 * An optimization inherited from MBF has been fixed which led to sprites not being rendered on the lowest possible floor (thanks @retro65).
 * Only non-sky flats are now checked for the swirling effect.
 * Crushed non-bleeding monsters are not removed off the map anymore, their sprites are replaced with the invisible SPR_TNT1 instead (thanks ZeroMaster010 and sorry for the desyncing demo).
 * Sigil is not auto-loaded anymore with the Freedoom Phase 1 IWAD, since Sigil's own texture definitions may clash with the ones from Freedoom (thanks @Some1NamedNate).
 * A brightmap definition for an animated flat sequence in HacX has been fixed.
 * Some fixes to the "--enable-truecolor" configure option have been implemented (i.e. the --disable-truecolor option, the rendering of the status bar bezel, fuzzy column drawing and the translucency factor - thanks xttl).
 * Window height adjustment when changing window size has been brought back at the cost of the window shrinking when repeatedly changing the widescreen option.
 * Parts of the status bar being visible during the initial wipe in widescreen mode has been fixed (thanks xttl).

**Crispy Heretic**

 * The level restart key now restarts the current demo recording from the map it was started, but under a new name (thanks @thom-wye).
 * Demo file names may now have arbitrary length (inherited from Chocolate Doom, also applied to the Hexen sources).
 * The demo file size limit has been removed (also applied to the Hexen and Strife sources).
 * The top border not always being drawn correctly in hires mode for all reduced screen sizes has been fixed (thanks @xttl).

**Known Issues**

 * Users who insist on the pure Vanilla experience that was formerly applied to the No Rest for the Living and The Masterlevels expansions or who need it to properly play back demos recorded with a previous release will have to rename their PWAD files and explicitly load them on the command line.

Crispy Doom 5.10.0 is based on Chocolate Doom 3.0.1 and has merged all changes to the Chocolate Doom master branch up to commit [`b26157ac`](https://github.com/chocolate-doom/chocolate-doom/commit/b26157aca5b12049b35d8dfcf969c51967a369f6).

## Acknowledgement

Although I have played the thought of hacking on Chocolate Doom's renderer for quite some time already, it was Brad Harding's [Doom Retro](https://www.chocolate-doom.org/wiki/index.php/Doom_Retro) that provided the incentive to finally do it. However, his fork aims at a different direction and I did not take a single line of code from it. Lee Killough's [MBF](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/WinMBF) was studied and used to debug the code, especially in the form of Team Eternity's [WinMBF](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/WinMBF) source port, which made it easier to compile and run on my machine. And of course there is fraggle's [Chocolate Doom](https://www.chocolate-doom.org/wiki/index.php/Chocolate_Doom) with its exceptionally clean and legible source code. Please let me take this opportunity to appreciate all these authors for their work!

Also, thanks to plums of the [Doomworld forums](https://www.doomworld.com/vb/) for beta testing, "release manager" Zodomaniac and "art director" JNechaevsky for the continuous flow of support and inspiration during the post-3.x development cycle and (last but not the least) [Cacodemon9000](http://www.moddb.com/members/cacodemon9000) for his [Infested Outpost](http://www.moddb.com/games/doom-ii/addons/infested-outpost) map that helped to track down quite a few bugs!

Furthermore, thanks to VGA for his aid with adding support for his two mods: [PerK & NightFright's Black Ops smooth weapons add-on converted to DEHACKED](https://www.doomworld.com/forum/topic/84859-black-ops-smooth-weapons-dehacked-mod) and [Gifty's Smooth Doom smooth monster animations converted to DEHACKED](https://www.doomworld.com/forum/topic/85991-smoothed-smooth-monsters-for-doom-retro-and-crispy-doom) that can make the gameplay even more pleasing to the eyes.
